### Hi there! I'm Mateus Ramos, a Senior Software Engineer specialized in Distributed Systems, GoLang, Rust and Flutter

I’ve been passionate about creating real-world value through technology ever since I began coding in 2014. Starting off with C for IoT solutions, I’ve grown into building robust systems using Go, Rust, Kubernetes, and Flutter. Throughout my journey, I’ve designed resilient architectures that power scalable, high-performance solutions across mobile, backend, and distributed environments.

Always driven by innovation and a passion for problem-solving, I’m committed to delivering top-notch solutions that boost business outcomes and elevate user experiences. Whether I’m architecting mission-critical applications or optimizing platforms to handle millions of real-time transactions, I focus on making a lasting impact through technology.
