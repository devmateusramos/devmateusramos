# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mateus Ramos, a Software Engineer specialized in Distributed Systems

I'm an experienced Software Engineer with 9 years in the field, specialized in Distributed Systems, Golang, Rust, Kubernetes. For the past 5 years, I've focused intensively on Distributed Systems, architecting and building robust, scalable solutions for financial systems and high-demand IoT services. My expertise spans the development of resilient architectures capable of handling millions of transactions and data points in real-time.

My journey in software development began in 2016 with C and IoT, providing me with a strong foundation in low-level programming. This background has been crucial in my proficiency with Golang, which I utilize for developing high-performance, concurrent systems and tackling complex distributed computing challenges.
While Golang, Rust, Kubernetes, and Distributed Systems are my primary focus, I'm also well-versed in a broader technology stack including C, C++, Zig, Java, Python, TypeScript, Flutter and React.
